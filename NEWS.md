# minVL 0.2.0

* Added min_vl_dists(), a vectorised version of min_vl_dist().
* Added min_vl_dist() for computing minimal voice-leading distances
(and forgetting about the actual voice leading).
* Added input checking for vl_dist(), 
now complains when the two input sets have different sizes

# minVL 0.1.0

* Added default arguments to `vl_dist`.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
